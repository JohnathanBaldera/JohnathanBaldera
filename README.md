## About Me

I am currently an Army soldier who is trying to find his path in Tech.  Technology has always been a strong passion of mine and working with technology is also what I do
in the military.  As I looked at the many jobs in tech, I started to see so much about Software Development and I taught back to how much I loved coding when I was taking
coding classes as part of my Information Technology Degree.  I decided being a Systems Engineer/Systems Administrator was no longer the role for me and I wanted to pivot into something that I would
actually look forward to doing every day.  With coding, I am can CREATE with technology.
