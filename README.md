## Quick Intro
- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnathanBaldera
- 👀 I’m interested in Personal Finance, MMA/WWE, and Video Games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many different things! I am about to start my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and am preparing for the upcoming coursework. I am also always practicing Data Structures and Algorithms.  I find doing algorithmic problems fun when there is no pressure.  Other than that, I am just working on projects that I am passionatte about and learning whatever I need to so that I can complete those projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that I ether use or know that can help many people.

## About Me

I am currently an Army soldier who is making the transition to the civillian sector.  I serve as a 35T - Military Intelligence Systems Maintainer/Integrator which carries responisibilities similar to System Engineers.  As I started thinking about transitioning, I started to think about what I really want to do as I get more choice outside of the military.  Software Engineering is the track that I decided to jump on as it's the one I most enjoy.  So here I am, coding and building projects that I am passionate about.
